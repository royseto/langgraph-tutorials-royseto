however, Barcelona missed out on the league title to Real Madrid.[284] On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini\\'s record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona\\'s history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez\\'s 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\\nDespite Messi\\'s individual form, Barcelona\\'s four-year cycle of success under Guardiola – one of the greatest eras in the club\\'s history – drew to an end.[131] He still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 March against Osasuna saw him overtake Paulino Alcántara\\'s 369 goals to become Barcelona\\'s top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against Real Madrid on 23 March made him the all-time top scorer in El Clásico, ahead of the 18 goals scored by former Real Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano.[160][162] Messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions.[161][163] For the first time in five years, Barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the Copa del Rey final by Real Madrid and lost the league in the last game to Atlético Madrid, causing Messi to be booed by sections of fans at the Camp Nou.[164]', 'score': 0.6396691, 'raw_content': None}, {'title': 'Lionel Messi | Biography, Competitions, Wins and Medals', 'url': 'https://olympics.com/en/athletes/lionel-messi', 'content': '“The Olympic gold in 2008 is the win that I value the most because it is a tournament that you may play only once in your life and involves many athletes from different disciplines” - Lionel Messi, Spanish Esquire\\nFeatured\\nLatest News\\nOlympic Results\\nAthlete Olympic Results Content\\nYou may like Lionel MESSI\\nBiography\\nBorn in Rosario, Argentina in 1987 Lionel Messi is widely held to be one of the greatest football players of his generation — and with good reason.\\n Graduating quickly through the club’s ranks thanks to his ever-growing skill set Messi made his first senior appearance for the club at the age of 17.\\n When he eventually left the team in 2021 for French club Paris Saint-Germain the Argentine completed his time in La Liga as its top goal-scorer, with an eye-watering 474 successful shots to his name.\\n He also came close to winning the FIFA World Cup in 2014 but Argentina fell to Germany 1-0 in the final.\\n', 'score': 0.6266047, 'raw_content': None}, {'title': \"Lionel Messi | Biography, Trophies, Records, Ballon d'Or, Inter Miami ...\", 'url': 'https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lionel-Messi', 'content': 'In early 2009 Messi capped off a spectacular 2008–09 season by helping FC Barcelona capture the club’s first “treble” (winning three major European club titles in one season): the team won the La Liga championship, the Copa del Rey (Spain’s major domestic cup), and the Champions League title. Messi’s play continued to rapidly improve over the years, and by 2008 he was one of the most dominant players in the world, finishing second to Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo in the voting for the 2008 Ballon d’Or. At the 2014 World Cup, Messi put on a dazzling display, scoring four goals and almost single-handedly propelling an offense-deficient Argentina team through the group stage and into the knockout rounds, where Argentina then advanced to the World Cup final for the first time in 24 years. After Argentina was defeated in the Copa final—the team’s third consecutive finals loss in a major tournament—Messi said that he was quitting the national team, but his short-lived “retirement” lasted less than two months before he announced his return to the Argentine team.
